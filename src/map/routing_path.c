     * How directions are stored:
     *
     * Since there are only 8 possible directions (0-7), each byte contains a direction
     * in the upper 3 bits (bits 5-7) and a count of how many times
     * this direction is repeated in the lower 5 bits (bits 0-4).
     *
     * For example, if a unit moves in direction 2 (right) for 10 tiles, this would be stored as:
     * Byte: 010 01001
     * where '010' is the binary representation of direction 2 and '01001' is the binary
     * representation of the count 9 (since we store count - 1, see below).
     *
     * Due to the 5 bits allocated for the count, the maximum number of consecutive moves
     * that can be stored in a single byte is 32 (and not 31 as might be expected).
     * Even though the count can represent values from 0 to 31,
     * we start counting from 1 (i.e., a count of 0 means 1 move, a count of 1 means 2 moves, etc.).
     *
     * If a unit moves more than 32 tiles in the same direction,
     * multiple bytes will be used for the same direction.
     *
     * This allows for efficient storage of paths with many consecutive moves in the same direction,
     * reducing the overall memory footprint of the path data.
